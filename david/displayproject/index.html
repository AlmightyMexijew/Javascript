        <h2>Welcome to the main page. This is where our content starts.</h2>
        <p>On our main page, we have a basic layout that allows for integrating other pages into our project. This means that we are able to link other pages, thus expanding our content and it's ability to reach our audience. A main page doesn't necessarily have to have all the content on a single page or by scrolling.</p>
