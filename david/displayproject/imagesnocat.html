        <h2>That's nice Gershon but what about images?</h2>
        <p>When we put images into a page, we need to have a good idea of where they are in space. Images function in a website or webpage by giving us a visual. The aesthetic and artistic side of a designer can be expressed through strategic placement of images.  They can be moved around, given JavaScript programming for interactivity, and sized according to your need.  Something important to understand about images is that they can be sourced in 2 different ways:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>They can be sourced directly from the same folder.</li>
            <li>They can be sourced directly from another website.</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <h2>What are the benefits between them?</h2>
        <p>Honestly they both have their benefits according to what your intent and infrastructure are. If you have personal images that cannot be found or easily accessed from elsewhere then it is in your benefit to source directly from a folder. This is part of the final stage of launching, when we upload and organize to your server. You <em><strong>MUST</strong></em> provide all the image content upfront however. During the design process it might impact the overall layout of things as spacing calculations, bordering, and other moving parts get tweaked.</p>
        <p>If you'd like to source from outside, that is perfectly fine too. Many people store photos in webstorage sites like imgur,jpgchurch, flickr, dropbox,etc.  Occasionally it's easier, if your goal is a generic stock photo, to simply get an address of a file and link to that. While you may need to credit it (there is such a thing as hearing from someone for credit not given), this is simple to include.</p>
        <ol>Ask yourself
            <li>Do I need loading speed?</li>
            <li>Do I want to rely on other sites for access to my content?</li>
            <li>Do I have the content I wish to use? Can I make it? Would I want to?</li>
            <li>Do I want to pay fees for storage?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>These factors and more can influence your decision. You are not bound to remain in either and you can freely mix between them; results may vary however on final outcome.</p>
        <h2>But Gershon what about the cat picture?</h2>
        <p>You've seen how pictures can influence the page. I purposefully included that so you could get an idea of the kind of influence images have on your page.  Setting a background image can have influence on the over-all look of your page. In our case we couldn't see very well what the text said. I played with the font several times in the process of creating the page just to see if there was a solution. The answer: there wasn't.</p>

        <p>Here is our cat at 300 pixels wide x 500 pixels tall. Clearly this is much better and yet it's still disproportionate and will take resizing to not look squished or funky. Keep that in mind when planning image content.</p>
