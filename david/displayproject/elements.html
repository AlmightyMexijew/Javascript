        <h2>Elements...What are they and why do they matter?</h2>
        <p class="explain">Elements are the pieces of the website. They might be something like a list, a paragraph, a table, images, embedded audio, and so on.  Each piece forms the eventual "cholent" of the page. Each piece can be manipulated. As demonstrated here, you can see the paragraph has a different color scheme than the previous heading. This was by intent and design. While it might be aesthetically off-putting, you should understand the level of control we can exercise in our ultimate design for your project.</p>
        <p class="explain2">Notice how this paragraph has an entirely different color scheme. The background color, text color, and the font family has been manipulated to present differently than both the title and the previous paragraph.</p>
