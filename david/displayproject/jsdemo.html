        <h2>What about functionality? What about interactivity?</h2>
        <p>With the power of JavaScript we can impact the user experience in a variety of ways. We can set buttons that <em>do things</em>. We can perform math. We can track where the user's mouse is. We can change pictures, fonts, colors. We can add and remove things. JavaScript also powers forms for things like sending a message. It even is how we asked for your name. <div id="uname">text</div> who is <div id="uage">text</div> years old. This too was JavaScript.</p>
