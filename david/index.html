    <!-- We're going to establish a page for David here. The goal is that we will show off a basic page with some cute JS features in it. -->

    <!-- structure: I want to have a structure of buttons.  A header/navbar with buttons, a changing text in the middle. Maybe a greeting prompt for fun at the front.-->

    <!-- navbar: Home/About/Services-->
    <!-- navbar/Home: This is a button that simply takes us back to index.html and clears text to original. Set variable for "original page" so we can just call that accordingly.-->
    <!-- navbar/About: This is a button that changes our p-id area to talking about us. Put something professional sounding inside.-->
    <!-- navbar/Services: This is a button that changes our p-id area to talking about our services offered. Include reiteration and rehashing of the contract.-->
    <!-- navbar/Contact Us: This button displays e-mail and phone contact for us.-->
