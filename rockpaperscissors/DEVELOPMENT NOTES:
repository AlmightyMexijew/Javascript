DEVELOPMENT NOTES:
After the initial find of a way that takes things randomly from an array, it successfully makes a choice and logs back an answer ("rock").

NEW PROBLEM:
the variable only takes one answer. We need to figure out how to move around between the choices. A single random choice will not cut it.

Solution?: After testing a function to run the following:
var randomAnswer = answers[Math.floor(Math.random() * answers.length)];
console.log(randomAnswer);

we could change assignment as necessary, leading to randomization.  Every time we ran function(), it would return us a different answer.
